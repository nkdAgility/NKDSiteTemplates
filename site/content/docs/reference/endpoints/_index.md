Endpoints are used to define the access to TFS/Azure DevOps servers. They are used to connect to the source and target servers for migration.

Endpoints are defined in the `endpoints` section of the configuration file. Each endpoint must have a unique name and specify the type of server it connects to, such as Azure DevOps Services, Azure DevOps Server, or TFS.
